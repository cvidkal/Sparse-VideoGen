A young Viking woman with her wolf-dog sitting at her feet. Born during the Midwinter solstice and named Winter, she stands amidst a snowy Nordic forest. Her attire features authentic colors: subdued blues from plant dyes, deep reds from imported materials, and earthy tones woven into her fur-lined cloak. Frost sparkles on her hair, and the icy landscape reflects her connection to the season. She is a hunter, a priestess, and a skald, embodying the spirit of resilience and mysticism
