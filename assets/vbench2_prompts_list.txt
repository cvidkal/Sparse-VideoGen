Finally, the camera pulls back, showing the entire street enveloped in stillness, with the flickering neon lights almost mocking the emptiness and desolation.
The camera starts at a rusted metal gate, with peeling paint revealing dull metal underneath, giving a sense of decay and unease. The gate creaks open, and the camera moves into a dimly lit corridor, with cracked tiles on the floor and exposed concrete in places. The light at the far end of the hallway is faint, creating an eerie atmosphere. As the camera moves forward, bloodstains on the walls become evident, and the air smells of mold and decay. The camera enters a former patient room, where the bed is torn apart, broken curtains flutter, and through the shattered window, an abandoned courtyard can be seen.
